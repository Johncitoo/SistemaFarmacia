 * The Customer constructor in C++ initializes the member variables with the provided parameters.
 * 
 * @param name The "name" parameter in the Customer constructor is a string that represents the name of
 * the customer. It is used to store the name of the customer object being created.
 * @param rut The "rut" parameter in the Customer constructor likely refers to the unique
 * identification number assigned to individuals in some countries, such as Chile. It stands for "Rol
 * Ãšnico Tributario" and is used for tax and identification purposes.
 * @param age The `age` parameter in the `Customer` constructor represents the age of the customer. It
 * is an integer value that indicates how old the customer is.
 * @param ifDisable The `ifDisable` parameter in the `Customer` constructor seems to be a flag
 * indicating whether the customer has a disability or not. It is likely a string parameter that can
 * hold values like "yes" or "no", "true" or "false", or any other indicator of disability status.
 * @param ifPregnant The `ifPregnant` parameter in the `Customer` constructor likely represents whether
 * the customer is pregnant or not. It seems to be a string parameter that could hold values like "yes"
 * or "no" to indicate the pregnancy status of the customer.
